## Forward/Reverse DNS Lookup and Visualization

### Contents: 
  
* `hw4/scripts`: contains the scripts used for the forward and reverse DNS lookups
* `hw4/tsv_files`: contains the `domains.tsv` file and other `.tsv` files are sent to this folder by the scripts
* `hw4/jupyter`: contains the Jupyter Notebook I used to create my graph 

### Running the DNS Lookup Scripts:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `python hw4/forward.py`
3. Run `python hw4/reverse.py`

Output will be sent to `hw4/tsv_files`

### Viewing the Graph

There's a screenshot of the graph I created in the `hw4` directory, but the `.png` version isn't interractive, so I recommend opening the `hw4/jupyter/viz.ipynb` notebook to check out the visualization, if you're interested.
